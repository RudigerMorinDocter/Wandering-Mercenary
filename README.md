# Wandering Mercenary for [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com)

> A military-based theme for [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com).

![Theme_Icon](https://github.com/RudigerMorinDocter/Wandering-Mercenary/Icon_Robot_Military_Animated.gif)

Made for all the code mercenaries out there ;) ! :wolf:

## Quick look

Colors are a collection of "Tan Brown" and "Ranger Green", coupled with red and blue accents. Inspiration comes from the Spitfires paintjobs !

I've come to make a lot of games in my spare time, most of which I'll never finish. This theme is derived from one of my games that I never released. At least the icon came in handy for the repo. :p

## Team

This theme is maintained by one dude. Me ! :snail:
